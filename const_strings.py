about_text = """Appvar Text Editor is a tool which allows you to easily store strings in an Appvar
(Files for TI83PCE and TI84+CE). You can then get a pointer of the string without the need of extra ram ! (if stored in archive)
This is very useful if your project has many strings. (Note: You cannot write to theses pointers)
To get these pointers, use the provided header and scource code in your project.
Note: This project uses some icons of fatcown icons pack: https://www.fatcow.com/free-icons
